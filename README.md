 This is a Repository of all models developed in fulfilment of 20LLP503 Dissertation Module at Loughborough University

 	 files description:  
    
  	  Dataset.xlsx - sheet labeled as ISEAR contains the feature reduced version of the ISEAR dataset following removal of less important features/columns
   	 KNN_ISEAR.ipynb - KNN model trained on dataset
     NB_ISEAR.ipynb - NB model trained on dataset
     SVC_ISEAR.ipynb - SVC model trained on dataset
     Logistic regression_ISEAR.ipynb - Logistic regression model trained on dataset 
     CNN_ISEAR_v3.ipyng - CNN model trained on dataset 
      
      In evaluating the effect of dataset size, number of emotion classes and dataset imbalance, the following notebooks were produced: 
      
      CNN_Anger_ISEAR_v2.ipynb - examining the effect of reducing the number of emotion classes to two classes (anger and others)
      anger,_joy_CNN.ipynb -   examining the effect of reducing the number of emotion classes to three classes (anger, joy and others)
      anger,_joy,_fear_CNN.ipynb - examining the effect of reducing the number of emotion classes to four classes (anger, joy, fear and others) 
      anger,_joy,_fear_sadness_CNN.ipynb - examining the effect of reducing the number of emotion classes to five classes (anger, joy, fear, sadness and others)
